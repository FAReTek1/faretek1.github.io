 trying to make a fortune's algorithm for a Voronoi diagram in goboscript

but the doc i was looking at wasnt too transparent on the implementation

im not sure how exactly i will structure it

![img_4.png](img_4.png)

<div style="align-content: center">i have directrix-based parabolas and their intersection but thats it</div>

also btw i implemented parabola struct as a vec3. interesting, i guess, but confusing because its xyz instead of abc

cant think too much about it, but ima work on pengine instead of voronoi rn tb

just implememnted bezply

oh my god pointengine is so, so useful and nice. whats even nicer is being able to edit all of these modules on the fly
