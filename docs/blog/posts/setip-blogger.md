# setip

 yes that reads setip not setup

Since this is supposed to be a blog for everything i do, perhaps i could just write as much stuff here as i want right? this is super casual stuff

i enabled anonymous commenting because sometimes, its annoying to login to random services

oh yes and iirc the real reason i wanted to make this was because i saw so many people using https://note.com/ but thats in japanese and i dont want to have to use google translate all the time

so yes. setip is a reference to some scratch project a while back by the way
