interestingly, uploading a post without a title just means you only see a date

that is exactly what i wanted. i am probably just going to update this single post today instead of making more. unless i want to make an actual article about something

does blogspot have rss feeds? that would be quite nice

oh its literally right here: https://monkeplace.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss

within the xml itself, there seems to be a difference between having alt=rss and not having that query param, but rss.app renders them the same

annoyingly, i cant comment with the same google account that im using to write this because the chrome profile im using doesnt allow that

maybe i should switch to a new chrome profile
actually ill do that 

yeah it works :)

meh ima play gs now
see how casual this is lol

perhaps this cant serve as a complete replacement for discord. but it is useful for stuff to do with specific projects, idk
