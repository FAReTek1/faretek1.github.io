 hello chat. 

today we are looking at scratchattach.editor

yeah there are some issues

anyway i got bored of that so lets do goboscript programming instead

there is a very weird/annoying bug regarding the %includes right now. hopefully it gets fixed at some point

ive recently switched to archlinux + kde, but i just used archinstall so im not sigma or anything. i wonder if i can use joplin to public publish a portion of my notes, e.g. on github.

I might transfer the stuff from here to there then, but nrn

there might exist gh things you can fork to create a custom blog, or maybe something with github pages idk.

but yeah thats a thing

ive also been making a vscode extension so i learned a bunch of typescript so thats cool (or not) i guess

so yeah, cant be bothered to put anything significant here, no one looks here anyway other than myself, unless i somewhow become not irrelevant and someone actually cares to read this

anyway goodbye, just posting this because i dont want the monke place to die
