# hello world

well i thought that i was sending too many messages in too many discord servers so i figured i would make something like this instead

but it seems to think that i am supposed to write a literal article, lol

i have about 5 'monke place's across multiple discord servers, and i was just thinking of making another, but i think this is enough.

so i made this thing. see if it works, heh

hello world is a thing from programming, obviously

maybe ill just throw this away in a bit, idk

they say the first thing you need to set up when doing any kind of programming is the console output. how are you meant to know what on earth is going on if you have no output!? What a nightmare that would be

anyway, 
<br/>&emsp;hello, world!

###### also wow i wish this had a markdown option.. literally might just port this to github for that lol
