# README

Hi, this is from faretek1 and it looks like you have found my blog.

!!! Question "I have a question for you, the one who is reading this:"

    Please tell me how you found this in the comments, 
    especially if it's an unconventional way. 

    If you did the same thing as someone else, consider just reacting with a :thumbsup:

    **I'm interested!!**

###### This defintetely isn't also because I want to see the comments have someone other than me, lol

## Links

Now that you made it to this place, I'll let you indulge in a couple of links (you probably don't care)

I'm not sure what else to put here. Also I directly linked the favicons of those websites, so they might disappear one
day...
