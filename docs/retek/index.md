## Hello

The above is displayed on my [GitHub profile README](https://github.com/FAReTek1),
but this area gives me a little more space to put stuff.

??? note "I am a programmer who (roughly in order):"

    - started with Scratch,
    - made a lot of intro animations in scratch,
    - learnt python, 
    - made a discord bot,
    - learnt a little bit of c++
    - started using GitHub,
    - started using markdown (duh),
    - contributed to open source repositories,
    - started using goboscript,
    - made a goboscript package manager,
    - made a lot of packages for that package manager,
    - learnt a minute amount of rust,
    - started using typescript,
    - started making a vscode extension,
    - made some docs using github pages and material for mkdocs,
    - started using javascript,
    - made a small userscript,
    - made a backend server for that userscript in flask,
    - and hopefully more in the future

??? note "Some other things about me (a lot of this is irrelevant)"

    - i live in the UK
    - i hate uk bebras
    - I think java looks ugly because of the indentation and boilerplate (this opinion may change)
    - I think that goboscript needs a lot of tools
    - I find scratch projects that avoid crediting by 'making things themselves' when concepts are clearly taken from other things (I'm talking about arc fillers) very annoying
        - I think that we should embrace the use of other people's code
        - This is why I love goboscript, as you can package things
    - I don't like using ai if possible. I usually use it if something is hard to find on google or if I am really, really stuck and everything I see, even if it seems relevant, doesn't work
    - I think I use the word 'I' too much
    - I try to be self-deprecating
    - I am an avid enjoyer of Lord of **the** Mysteries (the light/webnovel)
    - I want to acquire Japanese
    - I want to learn German
    - I installed arch linux :scream:
        - using archinstall :face_with_diagonal_mouth:
        - And I'm using KDE :face_with_diagonal_mouth: 
        - My graphics break every few hours so I have to restart my computer
        - My computer is very bad at running games
    - I have a discord server, there is a link in the footer of every page here
    - I use jetbrains ides and vscode (Ik so uncool)
    - emacs is hard but i have it installed
        - its only missing a good text editor
    - i also have vim installed because it literally comes with my os 
        - i just cannot work out how to exit it though
    - I webscraped my school
    - One reason why I really like FOSS is that it can be a completely free alternative for a simple job when other tools will ask for money
        - What I mean is that because we know how to use the command line, we save money
        - I once needed to parse an `.oab` file - an outlook offline address book
            - There were 2 options:
                - paid software which would only show u some data in a gui
                - later, i found a package on pypi which lets u do stuff programmatically as a library, or use the cli to convert to formats like `.csv`
            - Save money live better
    - I think anki is better than quizlet (another example of above ^^)
    - I think that this list is worryingly resembling an xml file tree
    - I use android, not ios
    - my profile picture is supposed to be a sillhouette of a recolored slime from terraria.
        - The original (coloured) slime:<br>![img.png](img.png)
