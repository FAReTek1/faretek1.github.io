## Hello

??? note "I am a programmer who (roughly in order):"

    - started with Scratch,
    - made a lot of intro animations in scratch,
    - learnt python, 
    - made a discord bot,
    - learnt a little bit of c++
    - started using GitHub,
    - started using markdown (duh),
    - contributed to open source repositories,
    - webscraped my school
    - started using goboscript,
    - made a goboscript package manager,
    - made a lot of packages for that package manager,
    - learnt a minute amount of rust,
    - started using typescript,
    - started making a vscode extension,
    - made some docs using github pages and material for mkdocs,
    - started using javascript,
    - made a small userscript,
    - made a backend server for that userscript in flask,
    - and hopefully more in the future

??? note "Some other things about me (a lot of this is irrelevant)"

    - i live in the UK
    - i hate uk bebras
    - I think java looks ugly because of the indentation and boilerplate (this opinion may change)
    - I think that goboscript needs a lot of tools
    - I find scratch projects that avoid crediting by 'making things themselves' when concepts are clearly taken from 
      other things (I'm talking about arc fillers) to the extent of essentially coping the code very annoying 
      (and I once did this myself)
        - I think that we should embrace the use of other people's code
        - This is why I love goboscript, as you can package things
    - I don't like using ai if possible. I usually use it if something is hard to find on google or if I am really, really stuck and everything I see, even if it seems relevant, doesn't work
    - I think I use the word 'I' too much
    - I try to be self-deprecating
    - I am an avid enjoyer of Lord of **the** Mysteries (the light/webnovel)
    - I want to acquire Japanese
    - I want to learn German
    - I installed arch linux :scream:
        - using archinstall :face_with_diagonal_mouth:
        - And I'm using KDE :face_with_diagonal_mouth: 
        - My graphics break every few hours so I have to restart my computer
        - My computer is very bad at running games
    - I have a discord server, there is a link in the footer of every page here
    - I use jetbrains ides and vscode (Ik so uncool)
    - emacs is hard but i have it installed
        - its only missing a good text editor
    - i also have vim installed because it literally comes with my os 
        - i just cannot work out how to exit it though
    - One reason why I really like FOSS is that it can be a completely free alternative for a simple job when other tools will ask for money
        - What I mean is that because we know how to use the command line, we save money
        - I once needed to parse an `.oab` file - an outlook offline address book
            - There were 2 options:
                - paid software which would only show u some data in a gui
                - later, i found a package on pypi which lets u do stuff programmatically as a library, or use the cli to convert to formats like `.csv`
            - Save money live better
    - I think anki is better than quizlet (another example of above ^^)
    - I think that this list is worryingly resembling an xml file tree
    - I use android, not ios
    - my profile picture is supposed to be a sillhouette of a recolored slime from terraria.
        - The original (coloured) slime:<br>![img.png](img.png)
